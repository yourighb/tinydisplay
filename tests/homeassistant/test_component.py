"""Tests for the Home Assistant custom component's packaging and boundaries.

The component itself cannot be imported here -- doing that needs Home
Assistant, which is deliberately not a dependency of this workspace. What *can*
be checked without it is everything that fails silently at runtime: a manifest
Home Assistant will refuse to load, translations that have drifted from the
strings they mirror, requirements that point somewhere they cannot be installed
from, and -- most importantly -- a library package that has quietly started
importing ``homeassistant``.

That last one is the rule the whole repository is arranged around, so it is
asserted rather than assumed.
