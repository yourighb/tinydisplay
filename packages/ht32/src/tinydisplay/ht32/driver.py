"""A :class:`~tinydisplay.core.DisplayDriver` for the HT32 panel.

The driver is deliberately thin. Encoding belongs to core, framing belongs to
:mod:`tinydisplay.ht32.protocol`, and writing belongs to
:mod:`tinydisplay.ht32.transport`; what is left here is the panel's fixed
geometry, the decision to build a whole frame before writing any of it, and
reconnection.

Panel size and pixel format are not constructor arguments. The HT32 is 320x170
RGB565 big-endian and nothing else, and a driver that let you ask for 320x171
would only be able to fail later and less clearly.

Example:
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> from tinydisplay.ht32 import HT32Driver, RecordingHidTransport
    >>> async def main() -> tuple[int, int]:
    ...     transport = RecordingHidTransport()
    ...     async with HT32Driver(transport=transport) as driver:
    ...         canvas = driver.create_canvas()
    ...         canvas.clear(Color.WHITE)
    ...         await driver.show(canvas)
    ...     return len(transport.packets), driver.frame_count
    >>> asyncio.run(main())  # 27 chunks make one frame
    (27, 1)

        serial_number: Restrict discovery to a panel with this serial. Ignored
            when ``transport`` is given.
        auto_reconnect: Whether a failed write should re-open the panel and try
            again. Turn it off when a failure should surface immediately.
        reconnect_attempts: How many times to retry a failed frame.

        portrait: Draw the short way round. The driver then reports itself as

            quarter revolution clockwise into the panel's 320x170 buffer --

            the panel's own orientation command does nothing. Combined with

        The panel in an AceMagic S1 is mounted upside down: a frame sent
        exactly as drawn arrives with its top-left corner in the bottom-right,
        and its text unreadable. The obvious remedy -- the panel's own
        orientation command -- does nothing. Every documented and undocumented
        value for it was swept against real hardware and none changed the
        image, so that command is inert on this firmware and the host has to
        turn the picture itself.

        Doing it here rather than in the widget layer keeps it where it
        belongs. This is a fact about one panel's physical mounting, not about
        drawing, and a dashboard should not have to know which way round its
        screen was glued.

        Rotating by half a revolution reverses both axes, and in a row-major
        buffer that is exactly reversing the sequence of pixels -- so this
        costs one reversed view of an array rather than an image rotation, and
        it is pinned to Pillow's own ``rotate(180)`` by a test.

        Found empirically here, and corroborated afterwards: the upstream Rust
        implementation carries an ``Orientation`` enum whose upside-down
        variants are documented as *software* rotation because "the hardware
        only supports two orientations", and implements that rotation by
        reversing the buffer's elements. Two independent reconstructions
        arriving at the same trick is a good sign the trick is the hardware's
