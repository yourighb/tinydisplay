"""The HT32 wire protocol: constants and packet construction, and nothing else.

This module performs no I/O. Every function here turns arguments into bytes,
which makes the part of the driver most likely to be wrong -- framing
arithmetic -- exhaustively testable with no device attached. The transport
layer above it does the writing and knows nothing about packet layout.

A packet is a fixed 4105 bytes regardless of payload: one HID report-ID byte,
an eight-byte header, and a 4096-byte data area that the final chunk leaves
partly zeroed. HID output reports are fixed-size, so short-packing the last
chunk would simply be padded by the OS anyway -- doing it here keeps the
written length constant and the write path free of special cases.

Frame layout::

    byte 0      HID report ID, always 0x00
    byte 1      signature, always 0x55
    byte 2      command
    byte 3      sub-command, or redraw phase
    byte 4      sequence number, 1-based
    byte 5      reserved, always 0x00
    bytes 6-7   pixel offset into the frame, big-endian
    bytes 8     high byte of the chunk size
    bytes 9+    pixel data, RGB565 big-endian

Two details of that layout are worth spelling out, because both look like bugs
until you do the arithmetic.

**The chunk size is effectively one byte.** Upstream writes the size as a
big-endian pair at bytes 8 and 9, then copies pixel data starting at byte 9 --
so the low byte is overwritten immediately and never reaches the panel. It does
not matter: both legal chunk sizes (4096 and 2304) are exact multiples of 256,
so the low byte is always zero, and the bytes that go out on the wire are the
same either way. This implementation writes only byte 8 and lets the pixel data
own byte 9, which produces a byte-identical packet without the dead store.

**The offset is counted in pixels, not bytes.** The field is 16 bits, and the
frame is 108,800 bytes -- which does not fit -- but 54,400 pixels, which does.
A byte offset would overflow at the twelfth chunk; a pixel offset tops out at
53,248 and fits with room to spare. See :data:`CHUNK_PIXEL_OFFSETS`.

Hardware bring-up later settled both questions and added a third. Independent
documentation for this panel states that bytes 4 to 7 are *ignored by the
firmware* outright, so the offset reading never mattered. And byte 0 is a HID
report ID, which is a convention of the ``hidraw`` API rather than part of the
protocol: the device's own byte 0 is the signature. Transports that do not go
through hidraw must drop it -- see :func:`device_payload`.

Example:
    >>> from tinydisplay.ht32.protocol import FRAME_BYTES, build_redraw_packet
    >>> packet = build_redraw_packet(bytes(FRAME_BYTES), 0)
    >>> len(packet), packet[1], hex(packet[2])
    (4105, 85, '0xa3')
