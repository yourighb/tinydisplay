"""The glue between Home Assistant and the TinyDisplay rendering stack.

Everything in this module is adapter code, and that is the point. The decisions
-- what a dashboard means, which entities it reads, when to repaint, what to
draw when a sensor drops out -- all live in ``tinydisplay.homeassistant``,
where they are covered by the test suite. What is left here is the part that
genuinely needs Home Assistant running: reading ``hass.states``, subscribing to
changes, and owning a task.

If this module starts making decisions, they belong one layer down.
