"""An image entity showing the last frame that reached the panel.

This is the answer to two questions that were previously only answerable by
reading container logs: *is it actually rendering?* and *what does the panel
look like right now?* Putting the frame on a Lovelace card answers both, from
a phone, without going near the machine.

It works on the preview driver too, which is the more useful half. A dashboard
can be written, previewed and corrected with no hardware attached at all --
the render loop draws exactly the same picture either way, because deciding
what to draw and deciding where to send it were separated three packages down.

The frame is encoded to PNG **when something asks for it**, not when it is
drawn. Most frames are never looked at, and a panel repainting every few
seconds should not be paying for a picture nobody has open.
