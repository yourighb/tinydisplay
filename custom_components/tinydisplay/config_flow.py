"""Config flow: pick a panel and a dashboard file.

The validation this flow performs is a single call into
``tinydisplay.homeassistant``. That is deliberate -- the rules about what makes
a dashboard valid are covered by the test suite one layer down, and duplicating
any of them here would create two answers to the same question, one of which
would eventually be wrong.

What the flow adds is the part that only makes sense with Home Assistant
running: checking the entities a dashboard names actually exist. That is a
warning rather than an error, because a dashboard written before the sensor it
watches is perfectly reasonable and blocking it would be obnoxious.
