"""The TinyDisplay integration: entity state onto a small hardware panel.

Setup does four things and delegates everything else:

1. Load and validate the dashboard file. A dashboard that does not parse is a
   permanent failure, not a transient one -- retrying will not fix a typo -- so
   it raises :class:`ConfigEntryError` and the entry shows the parser's message
   with the offending key's path in it.
2. Build the driver. Selecting the HT32 transport touches the USB bus, so it
   runs in the executor.
3. Start the render loop, which owns the connection from there on.
4. Arrange for all of that to be undone on unload.

Nothing here decides what a dashboard means or when to repaint. Those live in
``tinydisplay.homeassistant``, which is testable without Home Assistant
installed; this module is the part that is not, and it is kept small for that
reason.
